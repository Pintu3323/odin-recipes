    <h2>Steps to Make Chili Oil</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine crushed red pepper, cinnamon stick, star anise, Szechuan peppercorns, and garlic in a heatproof bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium until it reaches 225 degrees F to 250 degrees F (110 degrees C to 120 degrees C), 3 to 4 minutes.. Itâ€™s hot enough when a few flakes of crushed red pepper will sizzle in the oil.</li>
        <li>Pour oil over spices. Let stand until cooled completely, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Strain out spices with a fine mesh sieve, if desired.</li>
        <li>Label and store in refrigerator up to 6 months. For best results, always use clean utensils when handling the oil.</li>
