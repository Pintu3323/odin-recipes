        Fish tacos are a type of taco, popular in Mexican and Californian cuisine,
        featuring fish as the main filling. They typically consist of a corn or
        flour tortilla, fried or grilled fish (often white fish like cod, tilapia,
        or halibut), and various toppings like shredded cabbage or lettuce, salsa,
        and a creamy sauce (often a mayonnaise- or crema-based sauce with lime or
        chipotle).
